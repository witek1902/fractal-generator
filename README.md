# Fractal generation

> In mathematics a fractal is an abstract object used to describe and simulate naturally occurring objects. Artificially created fractals commonly exhibit similar patterns at increasingly small scales. It is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry. If the replication is exactly the same at every scale, it is called a self-similar pattern. An example of this is the Menger sponge. Fractals can also be nearly the same at different levels. This latter pattern is illustrated in small magnifications of the Mandelbrot set. Fractals also include the idea of a detailed pattern that repeats itself.
## About
This project was created in 2013. In January 2018 I decided to little refactoring and publishing it for open source. \
If you want to trace the refactoring process - look at commit history. \
In folder **old-src** you can see the old code written in **student times** with comment/code in polish language :)

## Requirements
 - Java 8
 - Maven 3

## TODO
1. Write tests.
2. Split Generator, because has too much responsibilities (FractalMouseListener, FractalMouseMotionListener, FractalKeyListener).
